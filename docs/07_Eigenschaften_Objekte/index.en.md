# Property windows of objects



The content of the property windows is "**oriented**" to the "**default of MIL-STD 2525C**** (= assignment of the corresponding modifiers). However, **not all modifiers** are **available** in ODIN (e.g.  Evaluation Rating etc.).

For those **symbols** (e.g. Natural Events, Action Points, etc.) that are **not specifically assigned** modifiers according to MIL-STD 2525C, we have added a **"basic set"** of properties so that you can at least enter the **most basic information** about them.

We have also included **modifiers**, which are not assigned according to MIL-STD 2525C, but which make sense from a tactical point of view (e.g. modifier "Special C2 HQ" for facilities such as JFTC, SHAEF etc.)

As soon as you confirm an entry in the properties window or select another field, the **display** of the entry **immediately** takes place on the **map** (if the modifier is to be displayed on the map according to MIL-STD 2525C).






## Input fields that are the same for different object areas



The fields below are included in various property windows, provide different choices, and are therefore described separately here:

The field **"Name"** or if this field is empty, then the field **"Unique Designation "** will be displayed in the "Layer Tree" (at Layer Management). If both fields are empty, the display in the "Layer Tree" will show **"N/A"** (not available):

| :------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: |

| ![](images/en/Gleiche_Eingabe_Name_5.png) | ![](images/en/Gleiche_Eingabe_Name_6.png) |



In the **"Hostility Status"** field you can select the following information for the object in a drop-down menu:

![](images/en/Gleiche_Eingabe_Hostility_Status_1.png)



For tactical graphics, "ENY" is displayed on the map if the Hostility Status **"Hostile"** is selected and the modifier "N" (Enemy) is provided for the respective object according to MIL-STD 2525C.

If the Hostility Status **"N/A"** is selected for Units, Weapons - Vehicles - Equipment, Facilities and Activities, the object currently disappears from the map. The tactical graphics can now be displayed in black color on the map with the hostility status **"N/A"** (e.g. in plans etc.):

![](images/en/Gleiche_Eingabe_Hostility_Status_2.png)



With **"Present"** and **"Anticipated/Planned"** you can define whether the object should be displayed solid or dashed on the map:

![](images/en/Gleiche_Eingabe_Gemeldet_Geplant.png)



In the **"Echelon"** field you can select the following sizes for the object in a drop-down menu:

![](images/en/Gleiche_Eingabe_Groeszensymbol.png)



In the **"Operational Conditions"** field, you can select the following information for the object from a drop-down menu:

## Civil SKKM symbols (AUT ONLY)



In order to enable a **Joint Common Operational Picture** between **military and civilian forces in Austria** in occasion cases (e.g. disaster cases, accidents on a larger scale, joint exercises etc.), we have implemented the basic national SKKM symbols as of version 0.18.0.

The SKKM symbols can be found in map palette best with the search term **"SKKM "**. Furthermore they are marked with the addition **"(AUT ONLY) "**. This serves information of our international users that these are purely national Austrian symbols.



The following properties can currently be entered for these objects:

| ![](images/en/SKKM_Symbole_Uebersicht_1.png) | ![](images/en/SKKM_Symbole_Uebersicht_2.png) |

## Symbols without modifier acc. to MIL-STD 2525C

| ![](images/en/takGrafik_Flaechensymbol_Uebersicht_1.png) | ![](images/en/takGrafik_Flaechensymbol_Uebersicht_2.png) |

- <span class="blue">11</span> height (from - to)



For area objects, the **Type of Space** and the **Unique Designation** (modifier "T") are displayed in the center of the area for those objects to which it is decidedly placed in the examples of MIL-STD 2525C.



For those area objects (e.g., airspaces) to which the **Effective (from)** (modifier "W"), **Effective (to)** (modifier "W1"), **Altitude (from)** (modifier "X"), and **Altitude (to)** (modifier "X1") properties have been dedicated in the examples, they are shown in the **Center of Space** on the map:



![](images/en/takGrafik_Flaechensymbol_Uebersicht_3.png)



For **area objects** that **cannot** be displayed on the **map** in ODIN at the moment, the **hierarchy path is marked in red font** and with the word **"(unsupported)"**.

Detailed information for the second section of the properties window can be found in the links/weblinks section.





## Links/weblinks section



In the **Links/weblinks** section you can add **links to files** on your **computer** or **weblinks to the Internet** to an object on the map:

| ![](images/en/Links_Uebersicht_1.png) | ![](images/en/Links_Uebersicht_2.png) |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

- <span class="blue">1</span> marked object on the map
- <span class="blue">2</span> switch to the properties area
- <span class="blue">3</span> current area for links/weblinks
- <span class="blue">4</span> drag & drop field to "link" the files/URL's
- <span class="red">5</span> display of the number of "linked" files/URL's
- <span class="red">6</span> display of the "linked" files/URL's (to open)
- <span class="red">7</span> button to delete the "linking"



With this you can add e.g. for a unit on the map the tactical command, troop disposition, info on weapons & equipment etc. and thus access corresponding information quickly and directly.

The respective files are opened separately in external programs (e.g. Word, Power Point etc.)



Linked documents are displayed in the layer management as follows:

![](images/en/Links_Layermanagement.png)



There is no limitation from the number of "links". However, in the layer management, if there are more than 100 links, only the number "99" is displayed.



When opening a "link", the following window appears for security reasons:

![](images/en/Links_Abfragefenster.png)



Here you can define if a link or URL should be opened (= **allow**) or not (= **reject**). If you don't want to confirm the query when executing each "link", you can select the function **"Always allow until next restart of ODIN"** to define the setting you have chosen.

After restarting ODIN you will be asked again when opening a link for the first time.

When **exporting** a **project** or a **layer** the links/weblinks will be exported as well. Note, however, that when importing the project/layer, only **those files or URL's** can be opened to which **the other user also has access** (e.g. shared folders on the server, etc.)



If a "link" is no longer valid, you will get the following feedback from ODIN:

![](images/en/Links_Fehlerhinweis.png)
